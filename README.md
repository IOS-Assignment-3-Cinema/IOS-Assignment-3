# Cinema App
As a team we came with the idea of making an app for buying cinema tickets. The aim is to let students find an easy way of entertainment. The target audience for this App are students. The aim of making this App is to let students book cinema tickets swiftly. Users can download the App, find a cinema, choose a movie and proceed to payment. In addition, they can visit the shop page to buy snacks and refreshments.
