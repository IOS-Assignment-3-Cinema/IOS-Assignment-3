## Introduction

We have created an application that solves a real-world problem for a fictional user persona. We followed an iterative product design cycle to produce a minimum viable product. On the final day of class, we will demonstrate the product to fictional investors in a presentation.

## Project Overview

The CineQuick is a SwiftUI-based project designed to provide a seamless movie booking experience. The application allows users to:

- Browse and select movies from a list of popular titles fetched from The Movie Database (TMDB).
- Choose showtimes and book tickets for their preferred movies.
- Select seats using an interactive seat selection interface.
- Add food and drinks to their booking for a complete cinema experience.
- View and manage their bookings through a dedicated bookings page.

### Key Features

1. **Movie Browsing**: Fetches and displays popular movies using the TMDB API.
2. **Seat Selection**: Interactive grid-based seat selection with real-time availability updates.
3. **Food and Drinks**: Allows users to add snacks and beverages to their booking.
4. **Booking Management**: Users can view and manage their bookings.
5. **Modern UI**: Built with SwiftUI for a clean and responsive user interface.

### Technical Details

- **Programming Language**: Swift
- **Framework**: SwiftUI
- **API Integration**: TMDB API for movie data
- **Design Approach**: Iterative product design cycle to create a minimum viable product

This project demonstrates the integration of modern UI design principles with robust backend services to deliver a user-friendly cinema booking experience.
